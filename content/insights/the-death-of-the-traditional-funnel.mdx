The linear path to purchase is a myth we've been telling ourselves since the Mad Men era. In 2024, the funnel isn't just leaking; it's evaporated.

Today's consumer journey behaves more like a pinball machine. Touchpoints are simultaneous, chaotic, and often contradictory. The brands winning today aren't optimizing conversion rates at the bottom of the funnel; they are building ecosystems of trust that surround the user.
