Physical fashion is slow. Digital fashion is instant. For Vortex, we bridged the gap.

## The Strategy

We released the "Digital Twin" of every garment 2 weeks before the physical launch. Users could wear them in social media filters. This built hype and scarcity. By the time the physical store opened, the collection sold out in 14 minutes.
