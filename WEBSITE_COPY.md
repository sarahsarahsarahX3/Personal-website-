Lumina approached us with a simple problem: their technology was brilliant, but their brand felt cold. We needed to inject warmth and narrative into a hardware company.

## The Approach

We started by interviewing 50 architects and interior designers. What we found was that they didn't buy "bulbs"; they bought "atmosphere". This insight led to our core campaign line: **"Don't just light a room. Define it."**

## Technical Execution

The website was built using WebGL to simulate real-time lighting effects on the product renders. This allowed users to "dim" the lights of the website itself, creating an immersive demo of the product's capability before they even bought it.

Physical fashion is slow. Digital fashion is instant. For Vortex, we bridged the gap.

## The Strategy

We released the "Digital Twin" of every garment 2 weeks before the physical launch. Users could wear them in social media filters. This built hype and scarcity. By the time the physical store opened, the collection sold out in 14 minutes.
